# Classification-Problem

Solution 4 is currently the best with an accuracy of 95.404 with the ROC metric. This was produced with the CatBoost(1) file. Solution 5 and 6 were produced using SMOTE which seems to just be adding more noise - I think SMOTE is only useful with a greater class imbalance.
Currently working on NEW.
